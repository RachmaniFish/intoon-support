      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>INTOON</strong> ("we", "our", or "us"). By accessing or using our app and related services (“the Service”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service.</p>

      <h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
      <p>INTOON provides personalized soundscape generation and audio experiences. Users can create, adjust, and save customized soundscapes generated using AI-based processing and curated audio assets. The Service includes:</p>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>Soundscape generation and playback</li>
        <li>User account management (via Google or Apple authentication)</li>
        <li>Subscription and payment via Apple App Store (StoreKit)</li>
        <li>Cloud-based audio storage and personalization</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article class="section">
      <h2>3. AI-Generated Content</h2>
      <p>Soundscapes are generated using AI technology (currently Gemini AI) under user direction and input. AI-generated results may not always be accurate or error-free and are provided for personal use only.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="section">
      <h2>4. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 16 years old to use the Service. If you are between 16 and 18, you must have permission from a parent or guardian.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="section">
      <h2>5. User Accounts</h2>
      <p>To access certain features, you must log in using Google or Apple authentication. We only request basic profile info (email, user ID) needed for account management. We do not store third-party passwords.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="section">
      <h2>6. Subscription and Payment</h2>
      <p>We offer Free and Premium subscription plans.</p>
      <p><strong>Premium Plan:</strong> USD 39.99 per year, billed via Apple App Store. Subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing period unless canceled.</p>

      <h3>6.1 Renewal and Cancellation</h3>
      <p>Your subscription will renew automatically each year unless you cancel it before the renewal date. You can manage or cancel your subscription through your Apple ID account settings on your iOS device or by contacting support at <strong>cencencwy@gmail.com</strong>. Cancelling prevents future renewals but does not automatically issue refunds for the current period.</p>

      <h3>6.2 Refund Policy</h3>
      <p>All payments are processed by Apple App Store. Refunds are generally not provided once a subscription period begins, except for limited cases such as duplicate charges or verified technical issues. Refund requests should be submitted through Apple's Report a Problem page or by contacting us at <strong>cencencwy@gmail.com</strong>. We reserve the right to deny refunds outside these cases, subject to consumer protection laws.</p>

      <h3>6.3 Timekeeping and Usage Quotas (UTC)</h3>
      <p>To avoid time zone discrepancies and ensure consistent enforcement of quotas and billing, all timestamps, usage tracking, subscription period calculations, and quota resets are recorded and enforced using <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>. This means subscription renewals, quota windows, and usage counters are evaluated using UTC, not the user's local timezone. Please plan accordingly to avoid unexpected behavior around local midnight or renewal boundaries.</p>

We do not disclose specific third-party source libraries to avoid potential confusion or copyright disputes.</p>
      <p>If you believe any generated content violates your rights, contact us at <strong>cencencwy@gmail.com</strong>. We will investigate and take action as appropriate.</p>
